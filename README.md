# OSSU-courses
A collection of my progress in the OSSU curriculum so far. The repo contains all the courses that are completed / still being worked on, with their specific projects / homework / practice problems / etc.
The <b>Core math</b> section will not have any problems included here, this will just be used as a check-list of the completed courses.
